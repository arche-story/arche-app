# Arche Story User Guide

## Welcome to the Origin of Every Idea

Arche Story is not just an AI image generator—it's an IP Provenance & Collaboration Platform. Every generated asset becomes a node in a rich graph of creative lineage, connected to its parents and protected by on-chain licensing.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First IP Asset

1. Connect your wallet using the button in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to the Studio Remix Station
3. Generate your original artwork using our AI tools
4. Add metadata and licensing terms to your creation
5. Register your IP asset on Story Protocol by clicking "Register IP"
6. Your artwork becomes a permanent node in the IP provenance graph

### Understanding Your Wallet Connection

- Arche Story uses your wallet to connect to Story Protocol
- All blockchain interactions require your approval
- Your private keys remain secure in your wallet
- Transactions are signed by you before being sent to the blockchain

## Remixing: The Heart of Creative Evolution

### How to Remix Existing IP

1. Browse the Provenance Gallery to find an IP asset you'd like to remix
2. Click on the asset to view its complete provenance history
3. Look for the "Remix" button on the asset details page
4. Enter the Parent IP ID in the Remix Station
5. Create your derivative work using the original as input
6. Define your licensing terms for the new creation
7. Register your derivative work on Story Protocol

### Understanding Parent-Child Relationships

When you remix an IP asset, your new creation becomes a "child" node in the provenance graph, with the original serving as the "parent". This creates an immutable chain of creative evolution that traces back to the origin of every idea.

### Remix Licensing Considerations

Before remixing:
- Check the original IP's license terms (Commercial or Non-Commercial)
- Ensure your intended use is compliant with the license
- Remember that your derivative work inherits license restrictions from the parent
- You can add additional permissions or restrictions to your derivative

## Understanding Licenses: Your IP's Legal DNA

### Programmable IP License (PIL) Types

Arche Story uses Story Protocol's Programmable IP License system to define how your IP assets can be used:

#### Commercial License
- Allows for commercial use of your IP
- Enables revenue generation from licensed works
- Requires revenue sharing as defined in terms
- Best for monetization-focused creators

#### Non-Commercial License
- Restricts use to non-commercial purposes
- Perfect for artistic expression and experimentation
- Maintains creative control over commercialization
- Ideal for portfolio and personal projects

### Setting Your License Terms

When registering an IP asset:
1. Navigate to the Licensing section in the Studio Remix Station
2. Select your license type (Commercial or Non-Commercial)
3. Define revenue sharing percentages (if applicable)
4. Add any specific usage restrictions
5. Review terms before registering on Story Protocol

### Derivative License Inheritance

When you remix an existing IP:
- Your derivative inherits license restrictions from the parent
- You can add additional permissions but cannot grant more rights than you hold
- Example: If the parent has a non-commercial license, your derivative cannot be used commercially
- Revenue sharing flows up the provenance chain to original creators

## Reading the Provenance Graph

### Visualizing Creative Lineage

The Provenance Gallery displays your IP assets as an interactive graph:
- **Nodes**: Each circle represents an IP asset
- **Connections**: Lines show parent-child relationships
- **Colors**: Different colors represent different creators
- **Sizes**: Node size indicates the number of derivatives or interactions

### Tracing IP Evolution

To explore an IP's history:
1. Click on any node in the graph
2. The graph will highlight the complete path from origin to the selected asset
3. View metadata, license terms, and creation details
4. See all direct derivatives of the selected IP
5. Follow the chain back to the original creator

### Provenance Information

Each IP asset display includes:
- **Origin**: The original creator and timestamp
- **Lineage**: Path through all intermediate derivatives
- **Current Holder**: Who currently owns the IP rights
- **License Terms**: How this IP can be used and remixed
- **Revenue Flow**: Historical revenue distribution
