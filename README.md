## 🌌 The Vision

**Arche** isn't just another AI image generator. It is a **provenance layer for creativity**. 

Inspired by the chaotic yet structured strokes of Van Gogh, Arche recognizes that an artwork isn't just the final pixel—it's the prompt, the seed, the iterations, and the creative choices made along the way. We bridge the gap between ephemeral AI generation and permanent, verifiable ownership using **Story Protocol**.

> "We remember not only the art, but the journey that birthed it."

## ✨ Unique Value Proposition

In the age of infinite reproduction, Arche restores value to the **origin**:

1.  **Provenance as First-Class Citizen**  
    Unlike standard tools that discard your draft history, Arche visualizes your creative path. Using a graph-based data structure, we track every prompt mutation and variation, creating a genealogy of your artwork.

2.  **Programmable IP (Story Protocol Integration)**  
    We don't just "save" images. We mint them as **IP Assets (IPA)** on-chain. This transforms your AI generations into liquid, programmable intellectual property that can be licensed, remixed, and monetized.

3.  **The Graph of Creation**  
    Visualize the relationship between your assets. See how "Prompt A" evolved into "Masterpiece B". Your creative history is no longer a flat list, but a living, breathing network of ideas.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎨 **Studio & Canvas**
- **Flow-State Interface:** An immersive environment designed for rapid iteration without distraction.
- **AI-Native Tools:** Generate, refine, and mutate assets using state-of-the-art models.
- **Context Awareness:** The system remembers previous iterations, allowing for coherent style evolution.

### 🕸️ **Provenance Graph**
